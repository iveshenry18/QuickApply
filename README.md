# QuickApply
A quick CLI application for resume and cover letter file management

# Filesystem Setup
The application creates folders of the form `./Specific/{Company Name}/{Role mm-dd-yy}`
## Resumes
The application recognizes resume versions of the form `./*_resume.docx`
## Cover letter
The application fills the file `cover_letter_stub.docx` at `{INSERTION POINT}` with contents chosen from `cover_letter_contents.xlsx` (see [example](https://github.com/iveshenry18/QuickApply/blob/master/EXAMPLE_cover_letter_contents.xlsx))
# Thanks
Many thanks to [Tanner Bobak](https://github.com/tannerbobak) for the initial script that became this over-engineered and underwhelming project!

_Web app (and [energy drinks](https://www.shlempo.com/)) coming soon!_
