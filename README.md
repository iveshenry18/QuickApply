# QuickApply
A quick CLI application for resume and cover letter file management

# Filesystem Setup
## Resumes
The application recognizes resumes in the working directory of the form `*_resume.docx`
## Cover letter
The application fills the file `cover_letter_stub.docx` at `{INSERTION POINT}` with contents chosen from `cover_letter_contents.xlsx`
# Thanks
Many thanks to [Tanner Bobak](https://github.com/tannerbobak) for the initial script that became this over-engineered and underwhelming project!

_Production-scale web app (and energy drinks) coming soon!_
